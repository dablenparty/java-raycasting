# Java Raycasting

A raycasting demo made with Processing 4

## How to run

- Clone this repo
- Download [Processing](https://processing.org/download) if you don't have it already (I made this on version 4,
  although you're welcome to try another version)
- Add the Processing folder to your classpath

I chose not to use Maven or Gradle because the version of Processing available in the Maven repository is far out of
date.

## About

I was inspired by the [2D Raycasting video](https://youtu.be/TOEi6T2mtHo) by The Coding train. That video uses p5.js,
but as an extra challenge (and to brush up on Java) I decided to use Processing instead and improve the algorithm with
help from [this article](https://ncase.me/sight-and-light/). Read it if you want a better explanation of the algorithm.
